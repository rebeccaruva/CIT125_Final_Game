// CIT125_FinalProject_ScrollingFroggerGame.cpp :

/*
a vertical scrolling frogger-like game called Hungy Flowey!
---
a flower is hungry so it must pass wall obstacles to reach the sun
and feed itself.

f is the player, a flower
o is the goal, the sun
# are wall obstacles that must be avoided

the player can move the flower with left and right arrow keys

there are 3 levels total, each with 50 lines total and each line
is 20 characters long

player score increases by 40 every level you successfully finish

each level will auto scroll at a speed of 1 (aka moves every 1 second)

there is a start screen, menu screen for in between levels/went hit obstacle,
and an end screen after successfully finishing all 3 levels

happy playing / reading!
